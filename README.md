## Project Overview

In today's corporate landscape, ESG performance is a crucial metric for evaluating a company's sustainability and ethical impact. This project delves into the ESG data of five hypothetical companies to assess their environmental footprint, social responsibility, and governance practices. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to inform strategic advice for improving ESG performance. This project specifically highlights my abilities in data exploration, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Files in this Repository

This repository is organized to provide a clear understanding of the project's data, analysis, and findings.

- `Assignment Intern.pdf`: This document outlines the initial assignment brief, detailing the project's background, objective, sample data, and required tasks (Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis).

- `raw_data.xlsx - Sheet1.csv` : These files likely contain the raw ESG dataset for Companies A to E. 
  
- `data_statsummary.xlsx - Summary Stats.csv`: This file contains the calculated summary statistics (mean, median) for each ESG metric, as requested in the "Data Exploration" task.

- `ESG Performance Analysis.docx`: This Microsoft Word document presents the comprehensive report of the ESG analysis, including key findings, correlation analysis results, and strategic recommendations. It serves as the primary deliverable of the project.

- `Visualisation Dashboard .pdf`: This PDF contains a tableau dashboard summarizing the ESG performance,  including charts and graphs that present overall ESG scores, environmental impact vs. ESG score, and company positioning based on environmental and social metrics.

## Data Description

The dataset includes ESG metrics for five companies (Company A, B, C, D, and E) for the most recent reporting year. The metrics typically include:

-   **Carbon Emissions (tons)**: Environmental metric, indicating the amount of greenhouse gases released.
-   **Water Usage ($m^{3}$)**: Environmental metric, indicating water consumption.
-   **Employee Diversity (%)**: Social metric, representing the percentage of diverse employees.
-   **Community Investment ($k)**: Social metric, indicating financial contributions to the community.
-   **Board Independence (%)**: Governance metric, representing the percentage of independent directors on the board.
-   **ESG Score (0-100)**: Overall ESG performance score.

## Analysis Performed

The project involved two main phases of analysis as per the assignment brief:

1.  **Data Exploration:**
    * Calculation of mean and median for each ESG metric.
    * Identification of companies with the highest and lowest scores for each metric.

2.  **Correlation Analysis:**
    * Determination of correlation between Board Independence and ESG Score.
    * Identification of trends or patterns between Environmental metrics (Carbon Emissions, Water Usage) and the overall ESG Score.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

The `ESG Performance Analysis.docx` and `Visualisation Dashboard.pdf` files contain the detailed findings and strategic recommendations. In summary, the analysis highlights:

* Overall ESG performance of each company.
* Identification of top and low performers based on various ESG metrics.
* Strong negative correlations between environmental metrics (Carbon Emissions, Water Usage) and the overall ESG score.
* Correlations between specific ESG metrics (e.g., environmental metrics) and the overall ESG score.
* Strategic recommendations tailored to help companies improve their ESG performance, focusing on areas such as minimizing environmental footprint, building social capital, and maintaining robust governance.
